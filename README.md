# Mcp Data Tools

MCP Data Tools - Model Context Protocol server for web data access

## Agent workflow this project demonstrates

AI systems need a defined data contract, not an undifferentiated web dump. `mcp-data-tools` focuses on **local-market research and lead-list enrichment**: it starts from a concrete request such as **"restaurants in Seattle"**, returns business names, public links, locations, ratings, and review signals, and makes those records available to an agent, RAG process, or analytics workflow.

## Implementation pattern

```text
user question → narrow query → structured public records → validation → agent context or business workflow
```

### What to validate before use

- Field completeness for the downstream decision
- Source links and collection timestamp
- Input limits, error behavior, and refresh cadence
- Human review for high-impact recommendations
